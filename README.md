A very simple backend to call custom commands via a webpage.

The Purpose:
When I'm laying on the sofa and watch Netflix/Disney+ via my Laptop that's connected to the TV,
I can't control the audio or pause the stream.
This allows me to open the webpage on my phone and control the web-player that way.
(It uses player-ctl and pulseaudio-ctl internally)
